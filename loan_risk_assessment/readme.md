# Loan Risk Assessment Model

This project is a machine learning solution for a money lending company to evaluate loan eligibility and recommend suitable loan amounts based on user risk profiles. It employs a two-step approach: a classification model to determine if a user qualifies for the minimum loan amount ($500), and a regression model to predict the optimal loan amount for eligible users (up to $50,000).

## Features
- **Eligibility Prediction**: Binary classification (Yes/No) for minimum loan eligibility.
- **Loan Amount Prediction**: Regression to estimate a suitable loan amount for eligible users.
- **Robust Data Pipeline**: Cleaning, feature engineering (e.g., debt-to-income ratio), and imbalance handling.
- **Optimized Models**: Random Forest for classification, XGBoost for regressionâ€”balanced for performance and accuracy.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data handling and manipulation.
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning utilities and pipelines.
  - `xgboost`: Advanced regression modeling.
  - `imblearn`: SMOTE for handling imbalanced data.
  - `joblib`: Model saving and loading.

## Installation
1. **Clone or Download**: Obtain the project files.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd loan-risk-assessment
Install Dependencies: Use pip to install required packages.
bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost imblearn joblib
Verify: Ensure all libraries are installed.
bash
python -c "import pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost, imblearn, joblib"
Usage
Prepare Data: Replace the synthetic data in loan_model.py with your dataset (e.g., CSV file).
Expected columns: income, credit_score, debt, employment_years, age, employment, marital_status, loan_status, loan_amount.
Example: data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv').
Run the Script: Execute the model training and evaluation.
bash
python loan_model.py
Outputs:
Classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC).
Regression metrics (MAE, RMSE).
Example prediction for a sample user.
Make Predictions: Use the predict_loan_eligibility function.
python
user = {
    'income': 50000, 'credit_score': 700, 'debt': 10000, 
    'employment_years': 5, 'age': 30, 
    'employment': 'Full-Time', 'marital_status': 'Married'
}
result = predict_loan_eligibility(user)
print(result)
Example Output: "Eligible for loan amount: $12345.67" or "Not eligible for minimum loan amount ($500)".
Saved Models: Models are saved as class_model.pkl (classification) and reg_model.pkl (regression) for reuse.
Load them with:
python
import joblib
class_pipeline = joblib.load('class_model.pkl')
reg_pipeline = joblib.load('reg_model.pkl')
Project Structure
loan_model.py: Main script containing data generation, cleaning, training, and prediction logic.
class_model.pkl: Trained classification model (generated after running).
reg_model.pkl: Trained regression model (generated after running).
How It Works
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values (median/mode imputation), removes outliers (IQR method), and fixes data types.
Feature Engineering: Adds dti (debt-to-income ratio) and stable_income (employment > 2 years).
Preprocessing: Scales numerical features, one-hot encodes categorical variables.
Classification: Random Forest predicts eligibility with SMOTE for balanced classes.
Regression: XGBoost estimates loan amounts for eligible users, capped at $500-$50,000.
Evaluation: Assesses performance with standard metrics (ROC-AUC for classification, MAE/RMSE for regression).
Customization
Real Data: Replace synthetic data with your dataset in loan_model.py.
Features: Add columns like credit_history_length or loan_purpose as needed.
Hyperparameters: Tune n_estimators, max_depth, etc., for better performance (e.g., via GridSearchCV).
Deployment: Extend to a Flask API:
python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)
class_model = joblib.load('class_model.pkl')
reg_model = joblib.load('reg_model.pkl')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    result = predict_loan_eligibility(data)
    return jsonify({'result': result})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Notes
Synthetic Data: The included dataset is for demonstration. Use real data for production.
Permissions: No special OS permissions required beyond Python execution.
Testing: Run in a virtual environment or VM for safety:
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
Compliance: Ensure fairness and document predictions for regulatory purposes if used commercially.
Scalability: Suitable for small-to-medium datasets (<100k rows); scale with dask for larger data.
